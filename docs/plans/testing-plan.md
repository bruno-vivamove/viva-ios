- [ ] Test dependency management (SPM packages)
- [ ] Test archive and distribution builds

### Environment Testing
- [ ] Test configuration switching between environments

- [ ] Test feature flags and environment-specific behavior

## Priority Levels

**High Priority** (Critical for release)
- Device testing with real HealthKit data
- Authentication security testing
- Core matchup functionality
- Critical user flows

**Medium Priority** (Important for quality)
- Unit test coverage
- Performance testing
- Error handling
- UI/UX edge cases

**Low Priority** (Nice to have)
- Comprehensive automated UI tests
- Advanced performance metrics
- Edge case testing

## Testing Framework Setup

### Current Status
- [ ] Set up XCTest framework properly
- [ ] Configure test schemes for different environments
- [ ] Set up test data and mocking infrastructure
- [ ] Configure CI/CD for automated testing

### Tools Needed
- [ ] XCTest for unit testing
- [ ] XCUITest for UI testing
- [ ] Mock frameworks for API testing
- [ ] Performance testing tools
- [ ] Device testing setup

## Notes

- This plan will be updated as new features are added or testing requirements change
- Priority levels may shift based on release timelines and business requirements
- Some tests may require physical devices (especially HealthKit and biometric features)
- Integration tests should cover the most common user scenarios first
