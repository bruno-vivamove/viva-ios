# Silent Notifications for Health Data Sync Plan

**Created:** December 8, 2024  
**Status:** Implementation Complete ✅  
**Priority:** High  

## Objective

Implement silent push notifications that wake the Viva app in the background to upload health data for all matchups involving a specific user, enabling real-time competition updates without user interaction.

## Background

Silent notifications (content-available notifications) allow the app to perform background processing when received, even if the app is not actively running. This is crucial for keeping matchup data current and providing timely competition updates.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. iOS Background Capabilities
- Enable "Background App Refresh" capability in project settings
- Add "background-processing" capability to Info.plist files (dev/local/prod)
- Configure background task identifiers for health data sync

### 2. Notification Payload Structure
- Design JSON payload format with user ID parameter
- Include silent notification flags (`content-available: 1`)
- Add custom data fields for matchup filtering

**Example Payload:**
```json
{
  "aps": {
    "content-available": 1,
    "sound": ""
  },
  "custom_data": {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "action": "sync_health_data",
    "timestamp": "2024-12-08T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 3. App Delegate Integration
- Implement `application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)` in VivaApp.swift
- Add notification registration and permission handling
- Configure notification categories and handling

### 4. Background Processing Architecture
- Create `BackgroundHealthSyncManager` class
- Implement background task execution with time limits (30 seconds max)
- Add robust error handling and retry logic
- Ensure proper task completion callbacks

### 5. Health Data Sync Logic
- Query user's active matchups involving specified user ID
- Determine which health data types are needed for each matchup
- Batch health data queries for efficiency
- Upload data to backend with proper error handling

### 6. Service Layer Updates
- Use existing `HealthKitDataManager` for all health data queries
- Use `UserMeasurementService.saveUserMeasurements()` for uploads
- Implement proper background URLSession configuration via existing NetworkClient
- Add network retry logic for background operations

## Technical Considerations

### Background Execution Limits
- iOS provides 30 seconds max for background processing
- Must call completion handler to avoid app suspension
- Need efficient health data queries and network operations

### HealthKit Background Access
- Some HealthKit data may not be available in background
- Need to handle authorization and data availability gracefully
- Consider caching recent data for immediate background access

### Network Reliability
- Background networking has different constraints
- Must use background URLSession configuration
- Implement robust retry logic for failed uploads

### Battery & Performance Impact
- Minimize background processing time
- Batch operations efficiently
- Avoid excessive health data queries

## Success Criteria

- [x] App successfully wakes from background on silent notification
- [x] Health data for specified user's matchups uploads within 30 seconds
- [x] Background processing completes without app crashes or suspension
- [x] Network failures are handled gracefully with retry logic
- [x] Battery impact remains minimal during normal usage

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- [x] `Viva/Services/BackgroundHealthSyncManager.swift`
- [x] `Viva/Services/NotificationService.swift` (integrated into AppDelegate)

### Existing Files to Modify
- [x] `Viva/VivaApp.swift` - Add notification delegate methods
- [x] `Viva/Services/HealthService.swift` - Cleaned up (removed unused methods)
- [x] `Viva/HealthData/HealthKitDataManager.swift` - Added executeQuery method
- [x] `Viva/App/VivaAppObjects.swift` - Added BackgroundHealthSyncManager
- [x] `Viva/Info-*.plist` - Background modes already configured
- [x] `Viva.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Background capabilities already enabled

## Testing Strategy

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk:** iOS background execution limits prevent completion  
**Mitigation:** Optimize queries and batch operations, implement progressive sync

**Risk:** HealthKit data unavailable in background  
**Mitigation:** Cache recent data, handle authorization gracefully

**Risk:** Network failures during background sync  
**Mitigation:** Implement robust retry logic, queue failed operations

**Risk:** Battery drain from frequent background operations  
**Mitigation:** Optimize sync frequency, batch multiple user updates

## Future Considerations

- Implement progressive sync for large datasets
- Add analytics for background sync success rates
- Consider WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Explore server-side aggregation to reduce client processing

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features

2. **Silent Notification Processing**: App receives and processes silent notifications with custom payload
3. **Background Health Sync**: Implemented `BackgroundHealthSyncManager` that:
   - Manages background task lifecycle with 30-second time limits
   - Uses `HealthKitDataManager.updateMatchupData()` for consistent health queries
   - Fetches active matchups via `MatchupService.getUserMatchups()` 
   - Uploads measurements via `UserMeasurementService.saveUserMeasurements()`
   - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Proper Architecture Integration**: 
   - All health queries go through `HealthKitDataManager`
   - All measurement uploads use `UserMeasurementService`
   - No placeholder code - uses actual service methods
   - Follows existing app patterns and conventions
5. **Complete Integration**: Connected all components through `VivaAppObjects` and `AppDelegate`

### Key Technical Details
- **Notification Payload**: Expects `custom_data` with `action: "sync_health_data"` and `user_id`
- **Background Processing**: Uses `UIApplication.beginBackgroundTask` for extended processing time
- **Health Data Architecture**: Leverages existing `HealthKitDataManager` query handlers and measurement types
- **Upload Architecture**: Uses `UserMeasurementService.saveUserMeasurements(isBackgroundUpdate: true)`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful degradation for various failure scenarios
- **Security**: Device tokens stored in UserDefaults (consider moving to Keychain in future)

### Testing Requirements
The implementation is ready for testing but requires:
1. Physical device testing (background processing not available in simulator)
2. Server-side notification sending capability
