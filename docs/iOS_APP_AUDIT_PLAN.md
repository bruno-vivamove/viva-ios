  - [ ] Implement TLS/SSL validation beyond default behavior
  - [ ] Add request signing or HMAC validation

### Xcode Project Configuration

  - [x] Fix Info.plist file assignments across build configurations in `project.pbxproj` *(COMPLETED)*
  - [x] Add test target dependencies for `VivaTests` and `VivaUITests` *(COMPLETED)*
  - [x] Consolidate duplicate package dependencies *(COMPLETED)*
  - [x] Fix default build configurations for each target *(COMPLETED)*

- [ ] **Fix deployment and compatibility**
  - [ ] Lower deployment target from iOS 18.0 to iOS 15.0 or 16.0
  - [ ] Fix background task identifier inconsistencies in Info.plist files
  - [ ] Review bundle identifier patterns for consistency

## ðŸŸ  MEDIUM PRIORITY (Potential Runtime Issues)

### Error Handling & Data Safety
- [ ] **Improve optional handling and bounds checking**
  - [ ] Fix force unwrapping of dictionary values in `MatchupDetailViewModel.swift` (lines 371, 381)
  - [ ] Add nil-safety checks for time interval calculations in `HomeViewModel.swift` (line 150)
  - [ ] Review and improve error handling in data loading operations

- [ ] **Fix threading and concurrency issues**
  - [ ] Ensure main thread access for UI updates in health data processing
  - [ ] Fix actor isolation issues in `UserSession.swift` (line 17)
  - [ ] Review token refresh handler concurrent request handling

### Input Validation & Data Integrity
- [ ] **Implement proper input validation**
  - [ ] Strengthen email validation beyond basic regex
  - [ ] Increase password requirements beyond 8 characters
  - [ ] Add input sanitization for user-generated content
  - [ ] Validate API parameter bounds and types

- [ ] **Improve data consistency**
  - [ ] Fix silent failures in keychain operations (`UserSession.swift`)
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for data cache initialization (`VivaApp.swift`)
  - [ ] Implement data integrity checks for stored session data

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Best Practices & Performance)

### Resource Management
- [ ] **Improve resource cleanup**
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of HealthKit background observers
  - [ ] Add automatic timer invalidation in error manager
  - [ ] Review memory usage in measurement processing operations

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Optimize data processing**
  - [ ] Reduce duplicate data structures in `MatchupDetailViewModel.swift` (lines 376-392)
  - [ ] Add rate limiting for concurrent health data operations
  - [ ] Review and optimize background task management

### Logging and Privacy
- [ ] **Improve logging consistency**
  - [ ] Ensure consistent use of privacy extensions throughout app
  - [ ] Review log levels for production builds
  - [ ] Remove or mask any remaining sensitive data in logs

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES & DECISIONS

### Completed Work Summary
- **Critical Priority**: All 10 items completed (100%) âœ…
- **High Priority**: 11 of 12 items completed (92%) - Only network security remains
- **Keychain Security**: Fully implemented with biometric protection and secure Apple ID storage
- **Memory Management**: All retain cycles and fatal errors fixed
- **Build Configuration**: Project properly configured with multi-environment setup

### User Decisions Made
1. **API Keys**: Client-side OAuth keys in Info.plist are acceptable (not server secrets)
2. **iOS Deployment Target**: Keep at 18.0 (user preference)
3. **Info.plist**: Should never be missing - handled by tests, not runtime checks
4. **Force Unwrapping**: Skip Info.plist key unwrapping fixes (handled by tests)
5. **Network Security**: Postponed for later implementation
6. **Commit Strategy**: One fix per commit, always build before committing

### Next Steps When Resuming
1. **Immediate Next**: "Fix deployment and compatibility" section (lines 51-54)
   - Lower deployment target (user said keep at 18.0, so skip)
   - Fix background task identifier inconsistencies  
   - Review bundle identifier patterns
2. **Alternative**: Move to Medium Priority items (optional handling, threading issues)
3. **Build Issues**: Project builds successfully with all current fixes

### Technical Context Learned
- Build failures were related to bundle copying (project config), not our code changes
- userSession scope issues in VivaApp.swift (fixed with vivaAppObjects.userSession)
- Test targets exist but schemes not configured for testing (acceptable current state)
- Package dependencies are clean and well-organized
- Multi-environment setup (Dev/Local/Prod) is properly configured

## COMPLETION TRACKING

- **Critical Priority**: 10/10 completed (100%) âœ…
- **High Priority**: 11/12 completed (92%)
- **Medium Priority**: 0/8 completed (0%)
- **Low Priority**: 0/6 completed (0%)

**Total Progress**: 21/36 items completed (58%)
