## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ITEMS NEEDING ATTENTION

### 1. Privacy Compliance (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ‚ùå **Missing PrivacyInfo.plist** - Required for App Store submissions since iOS 17
- ‚ùå **Missing health data usage descriptions** in `Info-prod.plist`:
  - `NSHealthShareUsageDescription`
  - `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`
- ‚ùå **Missing location usage description** (if location features are used):
  - `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`

### 2. Code Signing Configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code signing identity** currently set to "Apple Development"
  - Should be "Apple Distribution" for release/archive builds
  - Current setting may prevent App Store distribution

### 3. App Store Preparation
- ‚ùå **App Store Connect configuration** missing:
  - App Store metadata (description, keywords, categories)
  - App icons for all required sizes
  - Screenshots for different device sizes
  - App Store review information
  - Privacy policy and support URLs

### 4. Testing & Validation
- ‚ùå **Production environment testing**:
  - End-to-end testing with production Firebase
  - Production API endpoint validation
  - Performance testing on production configuration
  - Device compatibility testing

### 5. Release Process
- ‚ùå **Distribution workflow** not established:
  - Archive and upload process
  - TestFlight beta testing setup
  - Release notes and versioning strategy

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Firebase Analytics disabled** in production config
  - Consider enabling for production insights
  - Currently: `IS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED = false`

   - Change Archive build to use "Apple Distribution"
   - Verify provisioning profiles

4. **App Store Connect Setup**
   - Create app listing
   - Upload app metadata
   - Prepare screenshots and app preview

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
5. **Production Testing**
   - Test with production Firebase
