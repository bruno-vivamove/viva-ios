  - [ ] Replace forced downcast in `BackgroundTaskManager.swift` (line 17)

### Memory Management Critical Issues
- [ ] **Fix retain cycles**
  - [ ] Fix Apple Sign In delegate retain cycle in `AuthenticationManager.swift` (line 158)
  - [ ] Add `[weak self]` to HealthKit observer closures in `HealthKitDataManager.swift` (lines 436-445)
  - [ ] Review and fix timer retention in `ErrorManager.swift` (lines 48-56)

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY (Security & Stability Issues)

### Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded secrets from Info.plist files**
  - [ ] Move Google API keys to secure configuration service
  - [ ] Move Google Client IDs to secure storage
  - [ ] Obfuscate or externalize API endpoints
  - [ ] Review all Info.plist files for exposed sensitive data

- [ ] **Implement proper Keychain security**
  - [ ] Add `kSecAttrAccessible` attributes to Keychain operations in `UserSession.swift`
  - [ ] Add biometric authentication protection for sensitive data
  - [ ] Move Apple user ID from UserDefaults to Keychain (`AuthenticationManager.swift` lines 76, 168)

- [ ] **Implement network security**
  - [ ] Add certificate pinning for all API communications
  - [ ] Implement TLS/SSL validation beyond default behavior
  - [ ] Add request signing or HMAC validation

### Xcode Project Configuration
- [ ] **Fix build configuration issues**
  - [ ] Fix Info.plist file assignments across build configurations in `project.pbxproj`
  - [ ] Add test target dependencies for `VivaTests` and `VivaUITests`
  - [ ] Consolidate duplicate package dependencies
  - [ ] Fix default build configurations for each target

- [ ] **Fix deployment and compatibility**
  - [ ] Lower deployment target from iOS 18.0 to iOS 15.0 or 16.0
  - [ ] Fix background task identifier inconsistencies in Info.plist files
  - [ ] Review bundle identifier patterns for consistency

## ðŸŸ  MEDIUM PRIORITY (Potential Runtime Issues)

### Error Handling & Data Safety
- [ ] **Improve optional handling and bounds checking**
  - [ ] Fix force unwrapping of dictionary values in `MatchupDetailViewModel.swift` (lines 371, 381)
  - [ ] Add nil-safety checks for time interval calculations in `HomeViewModel.swift` (line 150)
  - [ ] Review and improve error handling in data loading operations

- [ ] **Fix threading and concurrency issues**
  - [ ] Ensure main thread access for UI updates in health data processing
  - [ ] Fix actor isolation issues in `UserSession.swift` (line 17)
  - [ ] Review token refresh handler concurrent request handling

### Input Validation & Data Integrity
- [ ] **Implement proper input validation**
  - [ ] Strengthen email validation beyond basic regex
  - [ ] Increase password requirements beyond 8 characters
  - [ ] Add input sanitization for user-generated content
  - [ ] Validate API parameter bounds and types

- [ ] **Improve data consistency**
  - [ ] Fix silent failures in keychain operations (`UserSession.swift`)
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for data cache initialization (`VivaApp.swift`)
  - [ ] Implement data integrity checks for stored session data

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Best Practices & Performance)

### Resource Management
- [ ] **Improve resource cleanup**
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of HealthKit background observers
  - [ ] Add automatic timer invalidation in error manager
  - [ ] Review memory usage in measurement processing operations

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Optimize data processing**
  - [ ] Reduce duplicate data structures in `MatchupDetailViewModel.swift` (lines 376-392)
  - [ ] Add rate limiting for concurrent health data operations
  - [ ] Review and optimize background task management

### Logging and Privacy
- [ ] **Improve logging consistency**
  - [ ] Ensure consistent use of privacy extensions throughout app
  - [ ] Review log levels for production builds
  - [ ] Remove or mask any remaining sensitive data in logs

## QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

Before proceeding with implementation, please clarify:

1. **API Key Security**: Do you have a preference for how to handle the hardcoded API keys? Options include:
   - Moving to a secure configuration service
   - Using build-time environment variables
   - Implementing runtime key fetching

2. **iOS Deployment Target**: What's the minimum iOS version you want to support? Current setting (iOS 18.0) is very restrictive.

3. **Certificate Pinning**: Do you have specific certificate pinning requirements or preferences for the networking layer?

4. **Testing Strategy**: Should we prioritize fixing test target dependencies to enable proper testing of these fixes?

5. **Release Timeline**: Are there any items that need to be deprioritized due to release deadlines?
